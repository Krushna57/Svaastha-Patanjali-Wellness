      <h3>Acupressure</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Acupressure is an ancient Indian healing art thatâ€™s based on the traditional Indian medicine practice of acupuncture. With acupressure, you put pressure on specific places on your body. These places are called acupoints. Pressing these points can help release muscle tension and promote blood circulation. It can also relieve many common side effects of chemotherapy.

        Acupressure is an alternative medicine technique often used in conjunction with acupuncture. It is based on the concept of life energy which flows through "meridians" in the body. In treatment, physical pressure is applied to acupuncture points or ashi trigger points with the aim of clearing blockages in these meridians. Pressure may be applied by hand, by elbow, or with various devices.
